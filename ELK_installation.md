Check wget:
wget --version
could be located: usr/bin/wget

if not, install wget:
wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh

if sudo command is not installed
apt install sudo

INSTALLATION:

1. Copy the "public key" of Elastic repo:
   sudo wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

!->	If gnupg, gnupg2 and gnupg1 do not seem to be installed, but one of them is required for this operation
{
apt-get update && apt-get install -y gnupg
}

2. Add Elastic's repo to system:
   echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list

check if it appears in /etc/apt/sources.list.d (elastic-8.x.list)

3. Install Elastisearch:
   apt update && apt install Elasticsearch

!!! Copy the info from console after installation

Example:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Authentication and authorization are enabled.
TLS for the transport and HTTP layers is enabled and configured.

The generated password for the elastic built-in superuser is : abc12345

If this node should join an existing cluster, you can reconfigure this with
'/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reconfigure-node --enrollment-token                   <token-here>'
after creating an enrollment token on your existing cluster.

You can complete the following actions at any time:

Reset the password of the elastic built-in superuser with
'/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic'.

Generate an enrollment token for Kibana instances with
'/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana'.

Generate an enrollment token for Elasticsearch nodes with
'/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Check status:
systemctl status elasticsearch.service

Start, status, stop:
systemctl status elasticsearch.service
systemctl start elasticsearch.service
systemctl stop elasticsearch.service

Add Elastisearch to autorun:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
Should be if normal:
"Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/elasticsearch.service â†’ /lib/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service"

Start Elasticsearch:
systemctl start elasticsearch.service


Check working:
curl -k -u elastic:abc12345 https://localhost:9200/

Where:
elastic - username (user account of Elasticsearch)
abc12345 - Elastic password from the previously mentioned info you copied from console.

LOGSTASH_INSTALLATION:
1. Key - if necessary
2. Repo - if necessary

3. Install Logstash:
   apt install logstash

4. Add autorun:
   systemctl enable logstash.service

5. Configs:

Main default config - /etc/logstash/logstash.yml

5.1 Create input.conf in dir /etc/logstash/conf.d
input.conf, context:

---
input {
beats {
port => 5044
}
}
---

There is a port to receive info from 'beats'.


5.2 Create output.conf in dir /etc/logstash/conf.d
output.conf, context:
-------------
output {
elasticsearch {
hosts    => "https://localhost:9200"
index    => "websrv-%{+YYYY.MM}"
user => "elastic"
password => "abc12345"
cacert => "/etc/logstash/certs/http_ca.crt"
}
}
-------------


5.3 Copy certs to Logstash:
cp -R /etc/elasticsearch/certs /etc/logstash

(should be according to 5.2 output cacert)

5.4 Set owner:
chown -R root:logstash /etc/logstash/certs

---
configurations, filters ???
---

Start, status, stop
systemctl status logstash.service
systemctl start logstash.service
systemctl stop logstash.service
